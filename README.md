## Functionality
This is the first time I have been able to execute the functionality of an assignment inclusive of javascript successfully! I am hopeful that this is a reflection on my knowledge advancement in javascript rather than the ease of the task. 

The Day Planner sets the current date using the moment.js, can store and retrieve saved input data, and also changes the html dynamically for time efficiency.
